# 🌦️ Weather Dashboard (Power BI)

## 📌 Overview

It provides a **7-day weather forecast** along with key metrics such as:

- Current temperature and weather conditions  
- Humidity, wind speed, pressure, and visibility  
- Sunrise and sunset timings  
- Air Quality Index (AQI) with pollutant breakdown  
- Chance of rain for the coming week  

The dashboard gives a clean, interactive, and visual way to monitor weather trends.
